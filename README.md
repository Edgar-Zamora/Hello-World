# About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Oklahoma where I earned my Masters Degree in Political Science. While at Oklahoma, I was introduced to R & RStudio in my first graduate course. Since graduating from Oklahoma in December 2018 I have been working at Big Bend Community College (BBCC) in Moses Lake, WA as a Data Consultant. At BBCC I wrangle, analyze, and visualize student data to allow stakeholders to make decisions about the direction of the college. Recently I have started integrating SQL into my R workflow because of the ability to have a workflow that allows for easier reproduce-ability. I training in Python is introductory but with my experience with R learning, it should be quick. With Tableau being a popular tool among businesses, I have managed to become proficient through my personal experience and having attended the 3-day accelerated training at the Tableau headquarters in Seattle in 2019.
