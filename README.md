# About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Oklahoma where I earned my Masters Degree in Political Science. While at Oklahoma, I was introduced to R & RStudio in my first graduate course. Since graduating from Oklahoma in December 2018 I have been working at Big Bend Community College (BBCC) in Moses Lake, WA as a Data Consultant. At BBCC I wrangle, analyze, and visualize student data to allow stakeholders to make decisions about the direction of the college. Recently I have started integrating SQL into my R workflow because of the ability to have a workflow that allows for easier reproduce-ability. I was have novice training in Python but plan on continuing with my training through self-teaching. Thought not found of it, I have training in Tableau. I have attended the 3-day accelerated training at the Tableau headquarters in Seattle in 2019. Since that I have developed dashboards for the college that use Excel files, static database files, and also live database files too. 

# This Repository

What you will find in this repository is work that I have compelted either for things like #TidyTuesday or work I have completed at my employment. The work can vary from visualizations in `ggpplot` to more complex things like a large report complied using the `bookdown` package and everything in between.
