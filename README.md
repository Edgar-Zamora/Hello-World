# About Me

I am a recent graudate from the University of Oklahoma where I earned my Masters Degree in Political Science. While at Oklahoma, I was introduced to R & RStudio in my first graduate. Since that day I have slolwing been building my skills. While in school I dabbled in R & RStudio but it was mostly for course work with minimal exploration. It was not until I graduate and entered by job that I was able to truly understand what R has to offer.
