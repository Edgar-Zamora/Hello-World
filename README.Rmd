This repository currently shows some of the contributions to the weekly TidyTuesday challenge. Each week my aim is to either grow my skills on a existing visualization type or to explore new package I have come across. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(slickR) #used to create sideshow
library(here) #help point to each image

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)

```
