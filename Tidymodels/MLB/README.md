Predicting MLB Attendance with `{tidymodels}`

Living in the Seattle metro there has been a long standing notion that
the Seattle Mariners are bound not to draw large crowds. The first
inclination may be to attribute it to the Mariners poor record[1]. There
are certainly other reasons for poor attendance which may include the
opponent, starting pitcher, day of the week, weather, and many other
factors than just their record. If I where an executive for a Major
League Baseball (MLB) team, I would like to know which games were likely
to have lower attendance so that corrective measures like giveaways,
special nights or other promotions could help attract larger crowds.

The rest of this post will attempt to create a model that will help
predict MLB attendance for home games. I strictly focus on home games
because I believe looking at away games is not necessary since MLB teams
may not have any interest in those games since they do not get revenue,
at least that is what I believe. I am writing this as the restrictions
for the COVID-19 pandemic are being lifted so some caution should be
taken applying a model trained on pre-COVID data to post-COVID games but
I think it is worth trying out.

# MLB Schedule

The MLB consists of 30 teams split into the American League (AL) and the
National League (NL). Within each league there are 3 divisions that
further split the teams into an east, central, and western division.
Teams traditionally most of their games against division rivals followed
league games and finally interleague games. Ultimately what that results
in a total of 164 games per team or 2,430 total games that span from
late March/early April to late September/early October.

[1] The Seattle Mariners have not made the playoffs since 2001, which is
the longest current streak of any North American pro sports team.
