# Predicting A Customers Shipping Mode ðŸ“¦

Having seen recent articles and tweets regarding the {tidymodels}
package, I decided to give it a try mysel. Today I decide to use the
superstore dataset that is commonly used when working in Tableau. The
superstore data records purchases from fictional customers regarding
various products.

As is customary, I load all the necessary packages and load the data.

```{r setup,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)

orders <- read_excel("data/Global Superstore.xls", sheet = "Orders") %>% 
  clean_names()
