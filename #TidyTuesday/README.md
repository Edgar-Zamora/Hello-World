# About
Contained within these folders is work that I have done for #TidyTuesday. Every week I attempt to hone some R skill, whether it be `tidyverse` related or something like importing fonts. In addition to building my R skills, I also include rmarkdown documents that help document what and why I am doing things a particular way. This not only help me build my writing and documention skills, but it also alwasy reproducible for others. Last, participating in #TidyTuesday allows me to engage with the R community through sharing my visualizations but also generating ideas from other visualizations I see.
