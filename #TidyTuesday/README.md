# About
In these folders you will be able to see some of the work that I have done for TidyTuesday. Every week I try and do something different. Some weeks I could work on importing and changing fonts. Other weeks it may be adding an image to the background. The goal of these is to build on my skills in R, whether they be my own creations or something I saw some else do. Also it gives other ideas when I post my work on to twitter (@Edgar_Zamora_)
