A portfolio of my work to the
<a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">\#TidyTuesday</a>
project and general `{tidyverse}` work. #Tidytuesday is a weekly event where <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_mock">@Thomas_mock</a> tweets out a dataset provided by the R community of which people are encouraged to explore. The basic premise of #TidyTuesday is to allow one to practice and showcase their R skills while also learning new ones from the R community. 

Every week I will attempt to try different visualizations using many different packages. Some that I have used are `gt`, `waffle`, and many others. Not only will I explore different packages, but I also explore the many `geoms_` that are currently avaiable in `ggplot`. Overall my aim of #TidyTuesday is to create visualizations that are both aesthically pleasing but also informative to others. To follow my work you can check out my < a href="https://twitter.com/Edgar_Zamora_">twitter</a>.

In addition to #TidyTuesday work, I include other general `tidyverse` work that can include my work with the `purrr` package and its abilty to iterate over lists and create mutliple outputs or it might be my work with the `xaringan` package to create a presenation for my job. 

As I continue my #TidyTuesday and general `tidyverse` work will continue to expand upon the contents available within.
