# Making Waffles
For this tidytuesday I decided to create a waffle chart using the `waffle` [package](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle) created by hrbmster. There are multiple ways to describe a waffle chart, most obvious being by looking at a picture of a waffle. However I find that analogy not that clear. I prefer to instead consider a Rubik cube. Lets start with the following image of a Rubik cube. Lets say one side of the Rubik cube is equivalent to our chart. We know that the max amount of individual cubes in one side is six. 

```{r rubik_cube, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("images/rubik_cube.jpeg")

```

The color combination will depend on the user similar to the way that our waffle chart will varying according to our data. Keep in mind there are limitations to this example because there is a finite amount of individual cubes while for a waffle chart there is not. 

Another key part of a waffle chart is the meaning behind each individual cube. In the Rubik cube example each individual cube could represent 1 person from a community of 6 or it could represent 1 million people. The value assigned to each cube is something to consider and note when presenting a waffle chart. 

From my experience, there are some limitations in using a waffle chart which are:

1. It is best to limit the number of categories because having to many can make the chart difficult to read
2. The default scaling may not be the most appropriate 

# Shaping data

With the dataset having 86 different bird breeds, it would have been difficult to plot them using a waffle chart. For that reason, I decided to only look at the birds with the most votes. To do that I counted the number of bird breeds within the dataset and than arranged them in descending. Doing so gave me the birds that received the most votes regardless of specific vote ranking. 

```{r shape_data_1}
#Place points
top5_votes <- nz_bird %>%
  filter(!is.na(vote_rank) & !is.na(bird_breed)) %>%
  count(bird_breed) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  rename(total = n)

#Getting names of the top 5 bird breeds to filter
top5_names <- top5_votes %>% 
  select(bird_breed) %>% 
  pull()
```

To make filtering easier in the next step, I `pull()` the names of the top five bird breeds and store them in the top5_names object.

The next step in shaping the data to conform to a waffle chart was to get the distribution of vote rankings for each bird breed. For example, the *Banded Dotterel* bird received 6692 total votes, but only by including `vote_rank` in the `count()` function are we able to see how many of those votes were first, second, and so forth. 

```{r shape_data_2, results='hide'}
#Filter birds to top 5 and scaling the data by dividing into 25 to make 
#creating a waffle chart easier
top5_breakdown <- nz_bird %>%
  count(bird_breed, vote_rank) %>%
  filter(bird_breed %in% top5_names) %>%
  left_join(top5_votes, by = "bird_breed") %>%
  group_by(bird_breed) %>%
  mutate(n = n/25,
         vote_rank = as.factor(vote_rank)) %>%
  select(c(-total))
```

To make the visualization understandable, I decide to make each square in a waffle chart represent 25 votes. The number is partly arbitrary and can be changed to any other number. 

# Visualization

To create a waffle chart, you use the `geom_waffle()` function from the waffle package. There is not much to add within the actual function other than the size and color of the boxes themselves. The key part of making this visualization work is adding the `facet_wrap()` because of its ability to separate the graph into each bird breed. Other than that the graphic is build like any other visualization. 

```{r waffle_chart, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(top5_breakdown, aes(fill = fct_rev(vote_rank), values = rev(n))) +
  geom_waffle(color = "white", size = .3, flip = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~rev(bird_breed), nrow = 1, strip.position = "bottom",
             labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 10)) + #will prevent overflow of labels
  scale_x_discrete() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) x * 25, # make this multiplyer the same as n_rows
                     expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0,50),
                     breaks = seq(0,50, by = 5)) +
  scale_fill_tableau(name = "1 sq = 25 votes",
                     labels = c("Vote 1", "Vote 2", "Vote 3", "Vote 4", "Vote 5")) +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(
    title = "Vote Rank Breakdown Among the Top 5 Bird Breeds",
    x = "Bird Breed",
    y = "Total Votes") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = .2),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank())
```
