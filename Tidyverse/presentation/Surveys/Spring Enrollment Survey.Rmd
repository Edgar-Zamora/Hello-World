  - Spring Enrollment Survey (*annual*)

.large[Survey Vetting Cont']


- With a large amount of survey being created and administered there are some problems that may arise:

  - The potential for survey fatigue is increase with each survey.
  
  - The content of surveys may overlap if creators are unware of related surveys.
  
  - Aim of a survey may be answered from a previous survey.
  
  - A survey may not be the most approcpiate way to gain insight into a proposed question.

- Questions to consider:

  1. Should **all** surveys be vetted by the Data Committee team or only those individuals that request Institutional Research administered the survey on their behalf. 
  
  2. How quick are we expecting a turn around on individuals who submit surveys for vetting?
