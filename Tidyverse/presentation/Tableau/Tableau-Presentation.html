# What is Tableau?

- Tableau is a data visualization tool that gives a user control of how to report and analyze data.

- Though there are other business intelligence (Power BI, SAP, Looker) tools, Tableau is thought to be the most commonly used data visualization tool across industries.
 - Tableau is used among most community and technical colleges in WA.
 - The SBTC maintains a server that IR uses to allow our dashboards to be accessible.
 
- Usability
 - A large benefit of using Tableau is the ability for it to be used and understood by differing people.
 - The amount of technical (programming/coding) skills needed is minimal because of it being point and click oriented.

# Locating IR Dashboards

- You can access the dashboards by going to the &lt;a style = "text-decoration:none" href = "https://port.bigbend.edu/employee/Institutional%20Research%20%20Planning/Forms/AllItems.aspx"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; &gt; Faculty &amp; Staff Workspace &gt; IR&amp;P (left panel) &gt; clicking on links

# Tableau Terminology

- Dashboard

- Filter/Filtering

- Aggregation (breakout by)



---
# Current IR Dashboards

There are 6 dashboards that can be viewed:

1. &lt;b&gt;Quick Facts&lt;/b&gt;
 - Provides a overall snapshot of important facts about the college for one academic year.
2. &lt;b&gt;Where Are Our Students From?&lt;/b&gt;
 - Maps the location of where BBCC students are from.
3. &lt;b&gt;Completions&lt;/b&gt;
 - Breakdowns the awards/degrees given to students for each year and over a 14 year period.
4. &lt;b&gt;FTE &amp; Student Faculty Ratio&lt;/b&gt;
 - Shows BBCCs FTE by year and program as well as displaying the student faculty ratio.
5. &lt;b&gt;Departmental Profile&lt;/b&gt;
 - Provides a general profile of departments at BBCC.
6. &lt;b&gt;Course Success Rates&lt;/b&gt;
 - Gives the success rates for individual classes at BBCC.
7. &lt;b&gt; Live Enrollment &amp; Waitlist &lt;/b&gt;
 - Will give you a daily count of students enrolled in a course as well as those waitlisted for a particular course

--
  - How many Running Start students did we have in the 2018-2019 academic year?

--
  - In the 2016-2017 academic year, how many female students between the ages of 25-29 were multiple goal seekers?
  
&lt;br&gt;

--
&lt;b&gt;Where Are Our Students From?&lt;/b&gt;

--
  - In the 2014-2015 academic year, how many students were from Sandpoint, ID?

--
  - In the 2018-2019 academic year why does Ritzville, WA have a figure when it has 11 students but Ellensburg, WA has 17 students but no figure?



---

# Exercise 2

--
&lt;b&gt;FTE &amp; Student Faculty Ratio&lt;/b&gt;

--
  - In the last ten year (2008-2009 to 2018-2019), what has the trend been for common course Chemistry in FTE and Student Faculty Ratio?

--
  - Comparing the Political Science and Spanish department, which has more FTE and a higher Student Faculty Ratio for the 2015-2016 academic year?
  
&lt;br&gt;

--
&lt;b&gt;Departmental Profile&lt;/b&gt;

--
  - Currently which program has the most students enrolled?

--
  - Comparing Hispanic Females and White Females in Business Information Technology, describe the enrollment trend starting with the 2014-2015 academic year.
  
  
  
---

# Exercise 3

--
&lt;b&gt;Course Success Rates&lt;/b&gt;

--
  - If I want to ensure I have the best chance of passing common course Political Science 202, what type of course delivery should I consider taking?
  
&lt;br&gt;

--
&lt;b&gt;Completions&lt;/b&gt;

--
  - How many students received a High School Equivalency&amp;reg; (GED) Certificate in the 2015-2016 Academic Year?

--
  - During the 2016-2017 Academic Year, what percent of students who received a AAS Commercial Pilot were white students?

# Final Thoughts

- If you encounter what to believe is a problem there are multiple ways to fix it.
  1. Hit the "Reset Filters" button
  2. Close the tab and reopen Tableau
  3. Switch browsers (most of the testing has been done in Chrome)
  4. If those solutions do not work contact Valerie (x2371) or myself (x2347)
  
- Remember that whether you filter, exclude, or highlight data you are in no way altering the underlying data, so do not be afraid to try different things.

- These dashboards are a ever evolving in that what you see today may change in the future. If you have suggests about ways to improve these dashboards we are open to hearing them.
