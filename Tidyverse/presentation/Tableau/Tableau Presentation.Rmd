# What is Tableau?

- Tableau is a data visualization tool that gives a user control of how to report and analyze data.

- Though there are other business intelligence (Power BI, SAP, Looker) tools, Tableau is thought to be the most commonly used data visualization tool across industries.
 - Tableau is used among most community and technical colleges in WA.
 - The SBTC maintains a server that IR uses to allow our dashboards to be accessible.
 
- Usability
 - A large benefit of using Tableau is the ability for it to be used and understood by differing people.
 - The amount of technical (programming/coding) skills needed is minimal because of it being point and click oriented.

# Final Thoughts

- If you encounter what to believe is a problem there are multiple ways to fix it.
  1. Hit the "Reset Filters" button
  2. Close the tab and reopen Tableau
  3. Switch browsers (most of the testing has been done in Chrome)
  4. If those solutions do not work contact Valerie (x2371) or myself (x2347)
  
- Remember that whether you filter, exclude, or highlight data you are in no way altering the underlying data, so do not be afraid to try different things.

- These dashboards are a ever evolving in that what you see today may change in the future. If you have suggests about ways to improve these dashboards we are open to hearing them.
