# Sample Tidyverse code

Contained in these folders are work that I have done using the Tidyverse packages. Some involves stuff from my current while other are projects that I have worked on in my spare time. For the most part I have tried to make the code reproducible, however there are constraints because some of these work is limited by proprietary reasons.
