Bryce Young (Santa Ana, CA), Kayon Thibodeaux (S. Los Angeles, CA), Matt Corral (Long Beach, CA), Kelee Ringo (Scottsdale, AZ) and many other college football recruits have decided to leave their state to attend a different college football program. Some like those listed above turn out to be Heisman Trophy winners (Bryce Young - 2022), potential top picks in the NFL Draft (Kayon Thibodeaux, Matt Corral) or contributors to a National Championship team.

The ongoing discussion among college football programs is that they need to keep as much in-state talent, especially 5 and 4 star recruits, while making inroads in talent rich states to build a winning team. With National Signing Day around the corner I decide to do a state analysis of college recruits to see which college programs are dominating each state.

The table can be thought as having three distinct sections. The **first** shows which programs are getting the most recruits from each respective state. The **second** section shows which in-state programs are getting the most commitments from in-state recruits. The **last** considers where top 300 in-state recruits are going.
